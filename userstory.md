1. I made a component for initializing a material page w/filter and changed the schema for logs and added routes to get the most recent logs for a material. Finishes the view all materials and view material logs per jobsite.
2. Create forms to add materials, checkout/checkin, create material notes(Maybe add a method for adding materials to a job site in my script)
3. No material for specific jobsites. Also no jobsites, Users need to be able to add themselves to a specific company. Companies don't exist on the material db
